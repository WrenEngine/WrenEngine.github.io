# Roadmap

🚀 **Wren Engine Roadmap** 🎮✨

Here’s a rough idea of where Wren is going. This is your public, transparent game plan for building a modern, modular game engine that doesn’t get in your way.

---

## ⚙️ Core Engine

- [x] 🏗️ Project setup & Rust workspace initialized
- [ ] 🎨 Rendering pipeline (2D first, modular design for 3D later)
- [ ] 🎮 Input handling (keyboard, mouse, gamepad)
- [ ] 🌳 Scene graph & entity/component system
- [ ] 🐞 Debugging tools, logging, diagnostics overlay
- [ ] 🧪 Test suite for engine modules

---

## 🖋️ Scripting (WrenLang)

- [ ] ✍️ Design & spec for Wren scripting language
- [ ] ⚡ Fast interpreter or JIT + native API bindings
- [ ] 🔧 Tooling: Hot reload, REPL, editor integration
- [ ] 🧠 Introspection & debug info
- [ ] 🔍 Error reporting, stack traces, editor-side script debugging

---

## 🎨 Visual Scripting (Wren Nodes)

- [ ] 🧩 Node-based visual scripting design
- [ ] 🖱️ Drag-and-drop prototype in Wren Studio
- [ ] 🔗 Node execution binds to scripting backend
- [ ] 🎲 Common nodes: conditionals, loops, animation, physics, audio
- [ ] 💾 Save/load scripts as assets
- [ ] ♿ UX pass for accessibility (non-coders, colorblind modes, etc.)

---

## 🛠️ Editor & Tooling (Wren Studio)

- [ ] 🏢 Wren Studio: lightweight native editor (Rust + egui or GTK)
- [ ] 📁 Asset manager & import pipeline (textures, audio, fonts)
- [ ] 👁️ Scene editor with live preview & scripting hooks
- [ ] 🔌 Modular plugin system
- [ ] 🔄 Git-friendly project structure & VCS integration
- [ ] 🧰 Integrated terminal & debugging console

---

## 🌐 Community & Ecosystem

- [x] 🌍 Website + Zola-based docs & tutorials
- [ ] 📖 API reference documentation (auto-generated)
- [ ] 💬 Launch Discord server + forum-style Q&A
- [ ] 📦 Crate-based package/asset sharing (via Git or future store)
- [ ] 🤝 Open source contribution guide & governance model
- [ ] 📣 Devlogs, release notes, and engine showcase section

---

## 🔮 Future / Stretch Goals

- [ ] 🌐 Multiplayer framework (ECS/network sync or rollback)
- [ ] 🤖 AI: State machine, behavior trees, navmesh tools
- [ ] 🕶️ VR/AR hooks for open standards (WebXR, OpenXR)
- [ ] 📱 Mobile build/export templates (Android/iOS)
- [ ] ☁️ Cloud builds / Web-based playground / Online IDE
- [ ] 💻 CLI tools for builds, asset pipelines, and CI support

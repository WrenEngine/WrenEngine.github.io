# ✨ Wren Engine Features

Wren is built for creators who want power **and** clarity.  
Here’s what makes it stand out.

---

## 🦀 Rust-Powered Core

Wren is written entirely in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) — giving you memory safety, performance, and modern tooling without runtime weirdness.

- ✅ No nulls, no segfaults, no data races
- 🧹 Built-in linting + formatting (Clippy + rustfmt)
- ⚡ Fast builds and optimized release binaries
- 🧰 Clean integration with the Rust ecosystem

---

## 🧱 Modular by Design

Wren doesn’t do the “monolithic engine” thing. Everything is modular.

- 🧩 Core engine is decoupled from the editor (Wren Studio)
- 🔌 Swap or remove systems like input, rendering, or scripting
- 📦 Easy to plug in existing Rust crates for extended features

---

## 🎨 Rendering Engine (WIP)

A lean 2D-first rendering layer built on `wgpu` or Vulkan.

- 🖼️ Clear, explicit draw APIs (not "magical nodes")
- 🌌 Designed to support pixel art, tilemaps, and UI cleanly
- 🚧 3D rendering support planned once 2D is solid

---

## 🎮 Input System (Planned)

A simple and sane input layer.

- 🎮 Abstracted gamepad, keyboard, and mouse input
- 🗺️ Configurable input mapping system
- ⌨️ Built-in support for rebinding and presets

---

## 🌳 Scene Management (Planned)

Wren’s scene system will be built for clarity and flexibility.

- 🌿 Hierarchical scene graphs with clear APIs
- 💾 Designed to be serializable + editable from day one
- 🧠 Works well with scripting, not against it

---

## ✍️ Scripting & Visual Tools

Wren will support both code and visual scripting — for all skill levels.

- 🛠️ Native scripting language (interpreted, Rust-agnostic)
- 🎛️ Visual scripting editor in Wren Studio
- 🧠 Built-in debugger + inspector for runtime scripts

> You won’t need to know Rust to prototype — but you can go deep if you want.

---

## 🎚️ Wren Studio (Planned)

A separate GUI editor for building, previewing, and managing your game.

- 🧠 Smart asset management + live scene editing
- 🔄 Git-friendly format for version control
- 🔌 Plugin support for custom tools or nodes

---

## 🔊 Audio (Future)

Not an afterthought. A proper audio API is planned.

- 🎧 Playback, spatial audio, and mixing
- 🎼 Extendable with audio plugins or DSP crates

---

## 🔍 Developer UX

You shouldn’t have to fight your tools.

- 📦 Small install size — target: <50MB for core engine
- 🐞 Built-in debug tools
- ✨ Clean CLI and scripting interface
- 🔧 Easy setup — no 100-step install process

---

## 💬 Community First

Wren is open source, transparent, and shaped by its users.

- 📘 Docs and tutorials from day one
- 🧠 Friendly for beginners, powerful for pros
- 🌐 Website, GitHub, and Discord to connect and contribute

---

Wren isn’t just a game engine — it’s a statement:

> **You deserve tools that respect your time, your creativity, and your machine.**

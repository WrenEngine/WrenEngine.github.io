# Wren Game Engine

🪶 Meet Wren

Wren is a game engine that doesn’t make you fight it.  
It’s built for speed, clarity, and actual creative control — not menus buried in menus.

- 🚀 Rust core = fast + safe  
- 🔩 Explicit architecture = no black boxes  
- 🎮 Easy 2D now, clean path to 3D later  
- 🖱️ Visual scripting coming = no need to learn Rust just to prototype  
- 💾 Small. Lightweight. No 100GB installs.

Whether you’re a programmer, artist, or somewhere in between — Wren is built to get out of your way and help you create.

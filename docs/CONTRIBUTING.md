# Contributing to Wren Game Engine

Hey! Thanks for thinking about contributing to Wren. We want this engine to be a place where everyone—from code wizards to creatives—can jump in and help shape the future of game dev.

## How to Contribute

### 1. Find something to work on

Check out the [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/WrenEngine/wren/issues) for bugs, features, or enhancements. Feel free to suggest new ideas by opening an issue!

### 2. Fork the repo & clone it locally

Make your changes on a new branch with a clear name:

```
### 3. Write clean, readable code

    Follow the existing code style and conventions.

    Keep things simple and explicit.

    Comment where it helps understanding.

    If you add new features, please add tests if you can.

### 4. Commit your changes properly

We use Conventional Commits for clean history. Examples:

    feat: add new rendering module

    fix: correct input handling bug

    docs: update README with new instructions

    chore: update dependencies

### 5. Push and open a Pull Request

Push your branch to your fork and open a PR against main in the official repo. Fill out the PR template, explain your changes, and be ready for feedback.

### 6. Be patient & open to feedback

We want this to be a positive experience for everyone. We might ask you to tweak stuff, and that’s totally normal!

Everything is modular.<ul><li>🧩 Core engine is decoupled from the editor (Wren Studio)<li>🔌 Swap or remove systems like input, rendering, or scripting<li>📦 Easy to plug in existing Rust crates for extended features</ul><hr><h2 id=art-rendering-engine-wip>🎨 Rendering Engine (WIP)</h2><p>A lean 2D-first rendering layer built on <code>wgpu</code> or Vulkan.<ul><li>🖼️ Clear, explicit draw APIs (not "magical nodes")<li>🌌 Designed to support pixel art, tilemaps, and UI cleanly<li>🚧 3D rendering support planned once 2D is solid</ul><hr><h2 id=video-game-input-system-planned>🎮 Input System (Planned)</h2><p>A simple and sane input layer.<ul><li>🎮 Abstracted gamepad, keyboard, and mouse input<li>🗺️ Configurable input mapping system<li>⌨️ Built-in support for rebinding and presets</ul><hr><h2 id=deciduous-tree-scene-management-planned>🌳 Scene Management (Planned)</h2><p>Wren’s scene system will be built for clarity and flexibility.<ul><li>🌿 Hierarchical scene graphs with clear APIs<li>💾 Designed to be serializable + editable from day one<li>🧠 Works well with scripting, not against it</ul><hr><h2 id=writing-hand-scripting-visual-tools>✍️ Scripting & Visual Tools</h2><p>Wren will support both code and visual scripting — for all skill levels.<ul><li>🛠️ Native scripting language (interpreted, Rust-agnostic)<li>🎛️ Visual scripting editor in Wren Studio<li>🧠 Built-in debugger + inspector for runtime scripts</ul><blockquote><p>You won’t need to know Rust to prototype — but you can go deep if you want.</blockquote><hr><h2 id=level-slider-wren-studio-planned>🎚️ Wren Studio (Planned)</h2><p>A separate GUI editor for building, previewing, and managing your game.<ul><li>🧠 Smart asset management + live scene editing<li>🔄 Git-friendly format for version control<li>🔌 Plugin support for custom tools or nodes</ul><hr><h2 id=loud-sound-audio-future>🔊 Audio (Future)</h2><p>Not an afterthought.
